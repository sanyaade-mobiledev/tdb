Appcelerator Titanium Command Line Debugger (tdb)
==================================================

This is a prototype project to build a Titanium based
command line debugger.  We're using it to test out the 
new Titanium Developer 2 visual debugger but it could be 
useful for command line debugging of your Titanium based
programs.


Right now, this is very experimental and a work in progress.


Requirements:

nodejs

Usage:

node tdb.js <ipaddress>
